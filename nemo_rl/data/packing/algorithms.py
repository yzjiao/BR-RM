        algorithm: The packing algorithm to use. Can be either a PackingAlgorithm enum value
                  or a string (case-insensitive) matching one of the enum names.
        bin_capacity: The maximum capacity of each bin.
        collect_metrics: Whether to collect metrics across multiple packing operations.

    Returns:
        A SequencePacker instance for the specified algorithm.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the algorithm is not recognized.
